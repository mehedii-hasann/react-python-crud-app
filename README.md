##**Difficulties I Faced :**
---

Since this web app has been deployed on **RENDER**, i tried to migrate sql database there.But it supports **PostgreSQL** and free tier expires in few days.
So if no database is detected while using this app, the **JSON** file will do the same duty.
The sql file is added and it can be used after pulling the project from repository and import the sql file to the **MySql**.
